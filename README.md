generate our own blog posts just from a single sentence let's take a deeper look as to what we'll be going through so in order to generate our blog post we're going to be using a library called hugging face so hugging face allows us to easily access a state-of-the-art natural language model called gpt2 so using gpt2 we're going to be able to pass through a sentence and have an entire blog post generated it's quite powerful and allows you to do quite a fair few different types of things so in order to do that we're going to be first up setting up hugging face gpt2 so we're going to install that and get it ready then what we're going to do is load up our model and encode our sentence so once we've encoded our sentence we can then pass it to our model and decode it and actually have our blog post generated we'll then also export this so you can have it as a text file let's take a deeper look as to how this is all going to fit together so first up what we're going to be doing is installing hugging face transformers so that's the name of the library for natural language processing then what we're going to be doing is preloading the gpt2 large model so this is going to give us a whole heap of power and grunt to be able to generate our blog posts .
